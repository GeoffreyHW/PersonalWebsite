                    <p id="takeoffinfo">Take Off is a mobile-conscious platform that uses genetic algorithms to suggest one-day vacation schedules to users.
                    The platform works by aggregating attractions and restaurants from both the Amadeus and Yelp APIs, while using the Google
                     Geocoding API to automatically convert locations to geographic coordinates. Users have the ability to specify what types 
                     of activities they are interested in before their schedules are generated. Once the user is ready, the platform will 
                     optimize the vacation schedule in a way that minimizes travel time and maximizes the ratings of attractions.</p>

                    <p id="paypalinfo">At Opportunity Hack 2016, my team was assigned to the NPO Hope for Hunger Food Bank. Their problem was that
                        volunteers would register on paper and then their staff would have to manually input all the information into an Excel sheet 
                        so that monthly statistics could be calculated. Our job was to automate that process to reduce their papertrail and manual labor hours.
                        I was on the team that developed the Android application where volunteers could sign in and have that data automatically exported to the
                        Excel spreadsheet.

                    <p id="researchInfo">To study the energy efficiency of augmented reality applications, I needed a reliable method to measure
                        desired characteristics. In order to characterize battery consumption, I hacked into the back of a Nvidia Shield tablet,
                        allowing power to come from either the Monsoon Power Monitor or the battery itself. The Power Monitor comes with software
                        that allows me to track average power usage over the lifetime of an application. Just altering the tablet's performance 
                        configurations has already shown varying results. For future work, I will continue to identify optimal settings and configurations
                        at which augmented reality applications perform.
